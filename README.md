Challenges:
1) Create a program that will ask the user's name, age and reddit username. Have it tell the information back. (Easy)
2) Create a program that will try to guess a number the user thinks of between 1-100. User does not enter the number into the program, but will only respond with "Higher" or "Lower" until program gets it right. (Hard)
